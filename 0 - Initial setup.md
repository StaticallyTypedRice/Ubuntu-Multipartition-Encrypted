# Initial setup

Install the Ubuntu flavor of your choice, choosing "set up encrypted LVM" at the storage configuration page.

It is highly recommended that a fresh installation that *doesn't already have any sensitive data* be used for this tutorial, as the data will have to be exposed as plaintext during this process. A fresh installation also makes restoring the system easy to restore if something goes wrong and the installation is bricked.
